Summary and Highlights: Foundations of Generative AI and Prompt Engineering
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:

In-context learning is a prompt engineering method where demonstrations of the task are provided to the model as part of the prompt.

Prompts are inputs given to an LLM to guide it toward performing a specific task.

Prompt engineering is a process where you design and refine the prompt questions, commands, or statements to get relevant and accurate responses.

Advantages of prompt engineering include that it boosts the effectiveness and accuracy of LLMs, ensures relevant responses, facilitates user expectations, and eliminates the need for continual fine-tuning.

A prompt consists of four key elements: the instructions, the context, the input data, and the output indicator.

Advanced methods for prompt engineering include zero-shot prompts, few-shot prompts, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency.

Prompt engineering tools can facilitate interactions with LLMs.

LangChain uses 'prompt templates,' which are predefined recipes for generating effective prompts for LLMs.

An agent is a key component in prompt applications that can perform complex tasks across various domains using different prompts.

LCEL pattern structures workflows use the pipe operator (|) for clear data flow.

Prompts are defined using templates with variables in curly braces {}.

Components can be linked using RunnableSequence for sequential execution.

RunnableParallel allows multiple components to run concurrently with the same input.

LCEL provides a more concise syntax by replacing RunnableSequence with the pipe operator.

Type coercion in LCEL automatically converts functions and dictionaries into compatible components.
