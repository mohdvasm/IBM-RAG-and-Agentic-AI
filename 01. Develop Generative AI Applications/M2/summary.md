Summary and Highlights: Introduction to LangChain in GenAI Applications
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

LangChain is an open-source interface that simplifies the application development process using LLMs.

The core components of LangChain are:

The language models that use text input to generate text output.

The chat models that understand questions or prompts and respond like a human.

The chat models that handle chat messages such as HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, FunctionMessage, and Tool Message.

The prompt templates that translate a userâ€™s question or messages into clear instructions.

The example selector that informs the model about the input context and guides the LLM to generate the desired output.

The output parsers that transform the output from an LLM into a suitable format.

LangChain is a platform that embeds APIs for the development of applications.

Chains are the sequence of calls in LangChain, and the output for one step becomes the input for the next step.

Chains first define the template string for the prompt, then create a prompt template using the defined template, and then create an LLMChain object name.

Memory storage is important for reading and writing historical data.

Agents are dynamic systems where the language model determines the sequence of actions.

Agents integrate with tools such as search engines, databases, and websites to fulfill user requests.
