Course Overview
Hello, and welcome to the Build RAG Applications: Get Started course.

Designed for aspiring artificial intelligence (AI) developers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers, this course provides the knowledge and skills to develop your skills with two popular retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. Throughout this course, you’ll gain hands-on experience with LangChain and LlamaIndex, two popular frameworks used for building in-demand AI-powered apps that use RAG. 

You’ll begin by exploring RAG fundamentals, learning how RAG enhances information retrieval and user interactions, before building your first RAG pipeline. 

Next, you’ll discover how to create user-friendly AI applications using Gradio, moving from project planning to constructing a QA bot using LangChain that can answer questions from loaded documents. 

You’ll compare two RAG frameworks, LlamaIndex and LangChain, and then develop an application with LlamaIndex to gain experience with a different RAG framework. Throughout the course, you’ll engage in interactive labs and leverage multiple large language models (LLMs), ensuring you have the skills to design, implement, and deploy RAG applications. 

This course is part of the 
IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate 
,  built to provide you with practical skills and knowledge you can use to excel in developing advanced AI applications that leverage RAG, multimodal AI, and agentic AI systems.

Prerequisites
This course requires working Python programming skills and experience, as the course emphasizes coding and application development. Additionally, fundamental knowledge of AI and web development is highly recommended. A strong foundation in generative AI is recommended but not required.

Objectives
After completing this course, you will be able to:

Explain why developers use RAG to build AI-powered applications.

Design user-friendly, interactive interfaces for RAG applications using Gradio.

Describe how the LlamaIndex framework supports building RAG applications and how it contrasts with LangChain. 

Build RAG applications using LangChain and LlamaIndex.
