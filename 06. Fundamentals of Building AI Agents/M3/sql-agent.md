# 📘 **AI-Powered SQL Agents with LangChain and IBM WatsonX.ai**

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

* **AI-Powered SQL Agent**: An agent that translates natural language queries into SQL using a large language model (LLM) and returns structured database answers.
* **LangChain SQL Agent**: A LangChain tool that connects LLMs to SQL databases, enabling dynamic query generation and execution.
* **Natural Language Interface**: Allows non-technical users to access and query relational databases using plain language.

## 📖 Definitions & Concepts

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQL Agent**                     | A system combining LLM + SQL backend to interpret natural language questions and return structured answers. |
| **Database Schema Understanding** | The agent’s ability to read and interpret tables, columns, and relationships in a database.                 |
| **Multi-step Querying**           | Performing multiple SQL steps to answer complex queries.                                                    |
| **Auto-retry Mechanism**          | Detecting and correcting failed queries automatically.                                                      |
| **LangChain**                     | A framework for building applications powered by LLMs with tool support (like SQL, web search, etc.).       |
| **WatsonX.ai**                    | IBM’s LLM platform that provides models like Granite for enterprise-level language understanding.           |

## 🧠 Agent Capabilities

1. **Natural Language to SQL Conversion**

   * Converts "How many albums are there?" → `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album`

2. **Schema Awareness**

   * Reads and selects only relevant tables, enhancing performance and accuracy.

3. **Multi-step Query Handling**

   * Supports complex workflows that require several SQL queries in sequence.

4. **Automatic Error Correction**

   * If a query fails, it retries with corrected syntax or table reference.

5. **Readable Natural Language Output**

   * Returns results in human-friendly format, not just raw SQL data.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Misinterpretation of vague or ambiguous queries.
* Complex queries may require developer oversight or manual tweaking.
* Performance and compatibility vary across LLMs and environments.
* Continuous testing is required to ensure reliability and correctness.

## 🛠 Example Workflow

### ➤ User Input:

> "How many albums are in the Chinook database?"

### ➤ Agent Flow:

1. **Input Received** (Natural Language)
2. **LLM Processes** → Generates SQL: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album`
3. **Query Sent to MySQL**
4. **Raw Data Returned**: e.g., `347`
5. **LLM Formats Answer** → “There are 347 albums.”
6. **Final Output Displayed**

## 🧪 Setup Process (LangChain + IBM watsonx.ai + MySQL)

### 1. 🐍 Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
virtualenv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. 📦 Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install ibm-watsonx-ai langchain mysql-connector-python
```

### 3. 🗄 Set Up MySQL Database

* Launch MySQL server in dev environment.
* Use sample **Chinook** dataset.
* Load using terminal:

```bash
wget <chinook_sql_file_url>
source chinook-mysql.sql
```

### 4. 📶 Verify Data

```sql
USE Chinook;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album;
```

## ⚙️ LLM Integration with IBM WatsonX.ai

### 1. Load Granite Model

```python
from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models import Model
from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM

model = Model(
    model_id="granite-13b",  # or your model ID
    credentials={...},
    params={"max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.7},
    project_id="skills-network"
)

llm = WatsonxLLM(model=model)
```

---

## 🔌 Database Connector Setup

### Define MySQL URI:

```python
from langchain.sql_database import SQLDatabase

uri = f"mysql+mysqlconnector://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db_name}"
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(uri)
```

---

## 🤖 Create SQL Agent with LangChain

```python
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent

agent = create_sql_agent(
    llm=llm,
    db=db,
    agent_type="zero-shot-react-description",
    verbose=True
)
```

### Run Query

```python
agent.run("How many Albums are listed in the database?")
```
