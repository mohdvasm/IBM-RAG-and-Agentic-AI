Summary and Highlights: Foundations of Tool Calling and Chaining
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 


Use simple LLM features for basic tasks, use workflows for predictable and efficient operations, and deploy agents only when complex reasoning or adaptability is needed.

AI agents sit at the highest end of the AI complexity spectrum, excelling at tasks that require autonomous decision-making, adaptation, and strategy. 

Use the four-step decision framework—task ambiguity, step flexibility, tool variety, and failure impact—to decide if an AI agent is the right fit for the task. 

Avoid using AI agents for simple, repeatable, or high-risk tasks where errors are costly or predictable; tools can perform better. 

Today's AI agents struggle with reliability, high compute costs, and often need human oversight to avoid hallucinations or missteps. 

Manage risks associated with AI agents by setting boundaries, using logs, monitoring outcomes, and keeping a human in the loop for oversight. 

Effective AI agent architecture includes modular components like memory, tool use, planning strategies, and clear reasoning paths.Tool calling enhances LLM capabilities by connecting them to real-time external data and functionality. 

Embedded tool calling improves LLM accuracy and reduces hallucinations by centralizing tool handling within a dedicated library or framework, replacing error-prone client-side implementations.

Tools help LLMs access external data and support RAG, enabling the use of the organization's or other specialized databases.

Tools help process images, audio, and video to enable vision, voice, and multimodal reasoning, manage long conversations, and connect to APIs to perform real-world actions.

The Zero-Shot ReAct Agent uses zero-shot reasoning to solve tasks it hasn't seen before and works best for simple or well-structured problems.
