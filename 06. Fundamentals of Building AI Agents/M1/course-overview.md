Course Overview
Hello, and welcome to the Fundamentals of Building AI Agents course.

This course is designed for aspiring software engineers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI architects, and automation engineers. It equips you with the knowledge and skills to develop and integrate intelligent AI agents. You’ll explore foundational concepts like tool calling, understanding how large language models (LLMs) can leverage external capabilities. You’ll also learn to orchestrate complex workflows using chaining, specifically with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).

As you progress, you’ll master building custom AI tools and defining agent behaviors to create smarter, task-driven AI applications. Through hands-on labs, you’ll implement both manual and built-in tool calling techniques, apply best practices for agent performance, and develop practical applications for data analysis, visualization, and database interaction. By the end, you’ll have the expertise to design and implement powerful AI agent solutions effectively.

This course is part of the 
IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate
, designed to provide you with the practical skills and knowledge to excel in developing advanced AI applications that leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal AI, and agentic AI systems.
