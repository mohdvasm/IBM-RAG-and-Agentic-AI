Reading: Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 

Multimodal AI
Processes and understands multiple types of data simultaneously

Key components: Text processing, computer vision, speech processing, text-to-speech, and multimodal fusion

Applications: Virtual assistants, healthcare, education, autonomous vehicles, content creation, and accessibility

Challenges: Data alignment, modality imbalance, resource demands, interpretability, bias in training data, handling sensitive information

Future trends: Unified models, edge computing, self-supervised learning, personalization, ethical AI, multimodal LLMs

Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Converts written text into natural-sounding speech

Combines linguistic analysis with speech synthesis

Traditional systems: Separate text analysis, acoustic modeling, and waveform generation

End-to-end systems: Use VAEs, normalizing flows, and GANs (e.g., VITS)

Applications: Accessibility, virtual assistants, education, entertainment, healthcare, navigation

Challenges: Natural prosody, emotional context, multiple speakers, real-time optimization, multilingual support

Speech-to-Text (STT)
Converts spoken language into written text

Involves audio feature extraction, sound understanding, word prediction, transcription matching, and refinement

Applications: Captioning, virtual assistants, medical transcription, language learning, note-taking, meeting and court transcription

Challenges: Background noise, speaker variability, real-time processing, domain adaptation, low-resource languages, context understanding

Future trends: Self-supervised learning, multilingual models, contextual understanding, personalization, edge computing
