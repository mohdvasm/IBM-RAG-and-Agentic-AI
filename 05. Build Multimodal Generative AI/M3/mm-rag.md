Hello, and welcome to this video on Introduction to Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation, or MM-RAG. After watching this video, you will be able to explain how AI systems retrieve and generate information across multiple data types, demonstrate the integration of diverse data modalities into retrieval processes, and design a generative model that incorporates multimodal context. Imagine an AI that can not only read text, but also understand images, retrieve relevant information from vast databases, and generate accurate responses. That's the power of MM-RAG, a cutting-edge approach combining multimodal understanding with retrieval augmented generation. Let's first understand what MM-RAG means. Multimodal refers to systems that work with multiple types of data, or modalities, typically combining visual information, such as images and videos, with text. Retrieval augmented refers to enhancing LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a database or knowledge store. Generation is where this retrieved information is used to generate detailed, accurate responses that combine the strengths of both modalities. While today's advanced vision models like Llama4, GPT-4o, or Claude 3 can see images, they don't have access to your specific knowledge bases or databases. RAG bridges this gap by retrieving relevant information to enhance the model's response with your proprietary or domain-specific data. The typical MM-RAG pattern follows three steps. The first step is retrieving relevant information across various modalities using specialized retrievers capable of processing text documents, images, audio recordings, and videos. The second step uses contrastive learning to train models that link related data from different types. For example, a picture of a cat and the phrase, a domestic feline, would be mapped to similar representations, helping the system connect images and text more easily. The final step is to use the retrieved multimodal data as context for generative models, enabling them to produce outputs grounded in a richer array of information. Let's look at the steps to implement MM-RAG. First is data indexing. Here, various data types are converted into embeddings and indexed in a vector database. This process involves transforming unstructured data, like text, images, audio, video, into a structured format that can be efficiently searched and retrieved. The second is data retrieval. When a user query, whether it's text, an image, or both, is received, it is converted into an embedding and searched in the vector database for semantically relevant data across all modalities. Step three is augmentation, where you combine the retrieved multimodal data with the original user query to provide comprehensive context for the generative model. The final step is response generation, where you input the augmented query into a multimodal generative model to produce a response that integrates information from the various retrieved modalities. Now, let's examine the practical implementation of the multimodal RAG through an example application called Style Finder. This system enables users to upload images of complete outfits and, using an external dataset, returns detailed information about the clothing items, along with purchase links. Let's break down the application's core components and explore the code that powers this multimodal fashion analysis tool. The first step in the pipeline is image encoding. It involves converting an upload image into a feature representation that can be mathematically compared with other images. This is achieved using a pre-trained ResNet50 model from torchvision. Each image is transformed into a feature vector and a Base64 string. This vector serves as the foundation for similarity matching in the retrieval step. After obtaining the image embedding, the next step is performing a similarity search. Here, the system compares the obtained image against a dataset of pre-encoded vectors to identify the most visually similar fashion item. In the code, cosine similarity is used to quantify visual closeness. The highest-scoring match is selected and used to retrieve all items that appeared with the same outfit image. To provide relevant context for the language model, the system retrieves structured data related to the matched outfit, including product names, prices, and URLs. This structured data will be formatted and included in the prompt sent to the language model. Next, the application sends the structured prompt and the Base64-encoded image to the Llama Vision Instruct model. The prompt is carefully engineered to include a professional context for catalog-style analysis, instructions to describe materials, patterns, and colors, a section for either item details or similar items, depending on the similarity score. The model then returns a structured, markdown-compatible response that combines visual reasoning with the retrieved metadata. In this video, you learned that MM-RAG combines multimodal inputs, such as text plus images or videos, with retrieval-augmented generation, fetching relevant data to enhance LLM responses. MM-RAG pattern follows three steps. First, multimodal data retrieval. Second, contrastive learning for embeddings. And third, generative models informed by multimodal context. The MM-RAG pipeline has four steps. In data indexing, diverse data, such as text, images, audio, and video, is converted into embeddings and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval. In data retrieval, the user query is embedded and semantically relevant multimodal data is fetched from the vector database. Augmentation is where retrieved data is combined with the original query to enrich the context for generation. Finally, in response generation, a multimodal response is generated using the augmented input, blending information from all modalities.
