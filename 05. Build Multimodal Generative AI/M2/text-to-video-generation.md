Hello, and welcome to this demo video on text-to-video generation with OpenAI's Sora. After watching this video, you will be able to describe the capabilities and underlying principles of OpenAI's Sora model and produce high-quality videos from text prompts using Sora. You'll also learn to modify generated videos by applying natural language edits and refinements. AI just took a massive leap. Sora isn't just about generating video. It's about transforming how we create, communicate, and build with moving visuals. So, what is Sora? Sora is a multimodal, diffusion-based transformer by OpenAI that generates high-quality video from text or images. It powers a range of applications, from creative storytelling in VR, AR, and games to content creation with custom characters and scenes, all without the need for animation teams. It enhances video editing through upscaling, interpolation, and gap-filling, and supports simulation by generating synthetic data for tracking, segmentation, and action recognition. Beyond OpenAI's Sora, several other tools support multimodal text-to-video generation. RunwayML's Gen-3 Alpha, which was built on diffusion-based techniques, offers cinematic video output with fine-grained motion control. Pika Labs enables stylized, animated clips from text and image prompts, ideal for storyboarding and creative prototypes. Google's Lumiere uses space-time diffusion to produce smooth, coherent motion in videos. While each tool varies in style and capability, core skills like prompt design and visual interpretation apply across all platforms. Let's walk through the basic workflow to generate a video with Sora. First, write a descriptive text prompt. Second, send the prompt to Sora. And third, receive a generated video clip as output. The more detailed and structured your prompt, the more accurate the result. When crafting prompts, focus on three essential elements. First, scene context. Describe the environment, location, and weather conditions. Second, visual details. Specify lighting, color tones, and camera angles. Finally, motion. Indicate any movement, such as slow motion, drone shots, or panning left. Sora is highly responsive to cinematic language, so prompts benefit from film-style vocabulary. To create a video with Sora, first, open your browser and navigate to sora.openai.com. This is the official interface for interacting with OpenAI's Sora model. If you're not already logged in, you'll be redirected to OpenAI Sora main landing page. From here, click on the Log In button on the top right to navigate to the authentication page. Here, log in using your OpenAI account credentials. If you don't have an OpenAI account already, select Sign Up to make a new account. Once logged in, you'll be taken to the main dashboard of the Sora interface. On the left, you'll see a navigation bar with options like Search, Explore, and Library. The Explore section, which is the landing page after you log in to Sora, allows you to browse videos created by others, providing inspiration and examples of prompt structure. At the bottom of the screen, you will see the Composer. This is where you describe in the text prompt exactly what you want to see in your video. For this demonstration, I'll use the following prompt. A black cat walks confidently across a sunlit rooftop at golden hour in a bustling city. Warm, low-angle sunlight casts long shadows as a drone camera slowly circles the cat, revealing the skyline. Rich, cinematic color tones with a hint of slow motion highlight the cat's graceful movements. Go ahead and enter the prompt into the input field. Before I create this clip, I'll review my settings. Under Type, make sure that Video is selected. I can change the aspect ratio, the resolution, and the duration of the clip. The number of variations of clips from a single prompt and style preset can also be changed. The available options will vary depending on your OpenAI subscription tier. Once everything is set, hit Enter on your keyboard or click Create Video. Your request will be added to the queue as indicated at the top right, and Sora will now begin processing it. This might take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes, depending on server load and the complexity of your prompt. Once your videos have finished processing, they will be saved under My Videos. You may hover over any variation to preview its playback in real time. To view a variation in detail, click on the video to open it in a lightbox. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the different variations in the set. After selecting a variation that you prefer, you may begin refining it using the editing toolbar. The bottom of the screen offers a range of editing options for modifying the selected clip. You can always make changes to your prompt, like editing the storyboard and recutting this clip, which lets you trim or extend any section of this video in the new timeline. Remix lets you use natural language to describe any changes you want to make in the video. Blend lets you transform the content of this video with that of another one. Loop lets you create a seamless repeating section of the video. For example, let's say I want to change the cat in the video to a fluffy orange cat instead of a black cat. I can select Remix, then type in what I want to change in natural language, then hit Enter to send the request to Sora to generate a new video with the change. Once a new video has been processed, it will be added as a new variation to your set. Here, you can see that the cat is now a fluffy orange cat instead of a black cat. Near the top of this section, you will see the option to add the video to favorites, like the video, get feedback about it, share the video, and download the video. And that is how you can create a video using natural language with Sora. If you'd like to dive deeper into the features covered in the editing toolbar, just click your user account menu in the top right corner and head to Video Tutorials for more details on other editing options. In this video, you learned that Sora is a multimodal diffusion-based transformer model developed by OpenAI that can generate high-quality video from text or image inputs. For accurate results, you must craft a structured prompt and include essential elements such as scene context, visual details, and motion required in your clip.
