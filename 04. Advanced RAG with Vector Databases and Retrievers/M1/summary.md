Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

A LangChain retriever is an interface that returns documents based on an unstructured query

There are several different types of LangChain retrievers

The vector store-based retriever retrieves documents from a vector database

A vector store-based retriever can be created directly from the vector store object with the retriever method by using similarity search or MMR 

That similarity search is when the retriever accepts a query and retrieves the most similar data

MMR is a technique used to balance the relevance and diversity of retrieved results

The multi-query retriever uses an LLM to create different versions of the query, generating a richer set of retrieved documents

The self query retriever converts the query into two components, a string to look up semantically, and a metadata filter to accompany it

The parent document retriever has two text splitters: a parent splitter that splits the text into large chunks to be retrieved, and a child splitter that splits the document into small chunks to generate meaningful embeddings

The core LlamaIndex index types are the VectorStoreIndex, the DocumentSummaryIndex, and the KeywordTableIndex

The VectorStoreIndex stores vector embeddings for each document chunk, is best suited for semantic retrieval, and is commonly used in pipelines that involve large language models

The DocumentSummaryIndex generates and stores summaries of documents, which are used to filter documents before retrieving the full content, and is useful when working with large and diverse document sets 

The KeywordTableIndex extracts keywords from documents and maps them to specific content chunks, and is useful in hybrid or rule-based search scenarios

The Vector Index Retriever uses vector embeddings to find semantically related content, and is ideal for general-purpose search and RAG pipelines

The BM25 Retriever is a keyword-based method for ranking documents, and it retrieves content based on exact keyword matches rather than semantic similarity

The Document Summary Index Retriever uses document summaries instead of the actual documents to find relevant content

There are two versions of the Document Summary Index Retriever, one uses LLM, and the other uses semantic similarity

The Auto Merging Retriever preserves context in long documents using a hierarchical structure, and uses hierarchical chunking to break documents into parent and child nodes

The Recursive Retriever follows relationships between nodes and uses references such as citations in academic papers or metadata links

The Query Fusion Retriever combines results from different retrievers using fusion strategies

The fusion strategies supported by the Query Fusion Retriever are Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Relative Score Fusion, and Distribution-Based Fusion
